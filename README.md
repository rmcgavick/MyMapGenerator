# MyMapGenerator
Experiment for playing with procedurally generated 2d height maps using a Perlin/Simplex noise algorithm.

The map is a JPanel which holds a 2d array of "MapTile" objects. In the future I will update my MapTile class so I can redraw its image, or make it an "active" or highlighted tile, or toggle its collision settings (making it a passable or non-passable tile). 

I would eventually like to use this as the foundation for a game, which I have some ideas for, but haven't settled on anything yet. For now, the maps just look cool!
